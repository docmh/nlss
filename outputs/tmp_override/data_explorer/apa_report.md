Variable overview

| Variable | Class | Scale | n | Missing % | Unique | M | SD | Min | Max |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| id | integer | interval/ratio | 12 | 0.0 | 12 | 6.5 | 3.6 | 1.0 | 12.0 |
| group | character | nominal | 12 | 0.0 | 2 |  |  |  |  |
| gender | character | nominal | 12 | 0.0 | 2 |  |  |  |  |
| dept | character | nominal | 12 | 0.0 | 3 |  |  |  |  |
| category | character | nominal | 12 | 0.0 | 3 |  |  |  |  |
| score1 | integer | interval/ratio | 11 | 8.3 | 10 | 12.3 | 3.0 | 8.0 | 17.0 |
| score2 | integer | interval/ratio | 12 | 0.0 | 12 | 24.6 | 5.1 | 18.0 | 33.0 |

Note. Scale levels are heuristic; interval/ratio cannot be distinguished automatically.
