age with wellbeing: Pearson's r = .59, 95% CI [.16, .83], p = .011, n = 18. Missing = 2 ( 10.0 %).
stress with wellbeing: Pearson's r = -.97, 95% CI [-.99, -.92], p < .001, n = 18. Missing = 2 ( 10.0 %).
age with performance: Pearson's r = .74, 95% CI [.41, .90], p < .001, n = 18. Missing = 2 ( 10.0 %).
stress with performance: Pearson's r = -.86, 95% CI [-.95, -.65], p < .001, n = 18. Missing = 2 ( 10.0 %).
Note. Two-tailed tests. Missing values handled pairwise.
