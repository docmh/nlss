Pearson correlations
Group: A

| Group | Variable 1 | Variable 2 | r | 95% CI | p | n |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | age | score | .89 | [.55, .98] | = .001 | 9 |
| A | age | stress | -.63 | [-.92, .14] | = .097 | 8 |
| A | score | stress | -.79 | [-.96, -.19] | = .020 | 8 |

Note. Two-tailed tests. Missing values handled pairwise. 95% CI computed via Fisher's z.
